## Introduction 

The Hangman Game is a word guessing game in which a user plays against the computer program to try and guess a random word within a certain amount of guesses.

## How to play 

Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase, or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers within a certain number of guesses. Read more about it here [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)/)

In this version a user is prompted to enter their game name, once they have done this a short instruction list will display before then being asked to input a guess. The random word will be displayed as some letters and dashes (w_r_) if the user guesses correct a dash will be replaced with a letter and if a wrong letter is chosen more parts of the hangman image will display. A user will win if they get the word within the set amount of guesses and they lose if they run out of guesses and the whole hangman image is displayed on screen.
